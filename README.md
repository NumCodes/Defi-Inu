# Defi-Inu
DeFi Inu (DFI) is an early–engagement decentralized reward project that allows users to mine and accumulate DFI tokens ahead of the official token launch. Users can participate, earn mining rewards, and securely store their balances until the token goes live — at which point they will be able to claim their tokens.
